                <h1>After Hours til Dawn</h1>
               <p id="pfirst">After Hours is a new wave and dream pop record that includes electropop and synth-pop influences. The album also contains elements of synthwave, electro, electro house, post-disco, trap, drum and bass, liquid funk, and synth-rock. Lyrically, After Hours explores themes of heartbreak, escapism, loneliness, promiscuity, overindulgence, self-loathing and regret. The artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: <b>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</b>, <b>Joker</b>, <b>Casino</b>, and <b>Uncut Gems</b>. The title of the album was inspired by the 1985 movie of the same name by <em>Martin Scorsese</em>. Tesfaye's physical appearance in the era has been described by journalists as being red-pigmented, with him consistently maintaining a red suit and specific hairstyle.</p>
               
               <p>Dawn FM is rooted in dance-pop and synth-pop genres. Recalling 1980s electronic bands such as Depeche Mode and Duran Duran, the album significantly incorporates new wave, funk, and EDM, alongside elements of disco, electropop, hip hop, city pop, soft rock, psychedelia, blues, boogie, electro, dubstep, drum and bass, and techno. Dawn FM incorporates a "psychedelic radio" aesthetic with existential themes. It features a dramatically aged version of the Weeknd as an elderly bearded man in a dark background setting with a small ray of light shining behind the back of his shoulder.</p>

                  <p >After Hours til Dawn Tour "will see the Weeknd's most ambitious production to date reflecting the creative journey that continues to unfold for both After Hours and Dawn FM, creating worlds within worlds as we have all been watching unfold in various television performances, music videos and short films bringing these first two pieces of his trilogy to life." The Weeknd's creative director and childhood friend La Mar Taylor explained in an interview with Variety that the tour would be theatrical and conceptual, saying: "<em>There is a linear story between After Hours and Dawn FM, and I think the audience will walk away with different interpretations of the show. To us, thatâ€™s the whole point.</em>" The stage design has 3 stages: the main stage, showcasing a row of destroyed buildings including Toronto's CN Tower, and a screen behind them showing visuals of a futuristic post-apocalyptic skyline; the main stage leads to a catwalk leading into a quadrangular stage, which features an inflatable moon over its edge and also unites the catwalk leading into a circular stage. During the second leg of the tour, the LED screen was removed in order to place more building statues, making the previous skyline fully physical. The band members play on top of their own individual buildings, while the Weeknd now performs half of the setlist wearing a white coat hoodie and a MF Doom inspired mask. The aesthetics went from rusty orange destroyed buildings to shiny chrome skyscrapers, as this leg is supposed to follow Dawn FM's overall theme. A Hajime Sorayama statue of the robot used in the 10-year anniversary music video for "Echoes of Silence" was also added in the middle of the stage.</p></div> </div>
